Allow Editors to manage menus
=====================

As per the title - allow editors to manage menus

![Overview](http://d7c3hoiply1bq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Menu-Icon.png)

## Usage

* Activate Plugin (there are no settings for this plugin)

## About

This is a regular request I get from clients. For this to work I have had to:

* Give editors the capabilities to edit theme options
* Remove the Apperance menu for editors
* Add a new menu item to manage menus (by way of a redirect)

## Contribute
